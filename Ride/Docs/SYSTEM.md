# Vehicle Managemnet Web System Documentation

## 1. System Overview
1.1 Purpose
This system is a web-based administrative platform designed for fleet and vehicle operations management. It provides integrated management of vehicles, warranties, parking, fleet services, operational status, subscriptions, and maintenance workflows.

1.2 System Goals
- Vehicle-centric data management
- Operation-oriented system design
- History-based data modeling
- Admin-oriented user interface
- Scalable and extensible architecture

1.3 Target Users
- Fleet administrators
- Operations managers
- Maintenance managers
- System operators

## 2. System Architecture
2.1 Frontend (Admin Web UI)
- AdminLTE + Bootstrap 5
- DataTables-based management UI
- Modal-driven interaction model

2.2 Backend (API Server)
- Python Flask
- Blueprint-based modular architecture
- REST-style API design

2.3 Database
- SQLite
- WAL Mode enabled
- Normalized relational schema

## 3. Technology Stack

- /api/parking/*
- /api/fleets/*

## 7. Frontend Architecture
7.1 Page Structure
Vehicle Operation View
Operational UI focused on real-time status, parking-based grouping, fleet connections, and quick actions.

Vehicle Management View
Management UI focused on vehicle master data, warranty control, fleet registration, and structural configuration.

Supporting Pages
- Dashboard
- Parking Management
- Fleet Management

7.2 UI Design Principles
Action-row based UX
Grouped table views
Modal-centered workflows
AJAX-based asynchronous operations

## 8. Business Logic Model
8.1 Vehicle Lifecycle
Registration → Operation → Maintenance → Deactivation → Archiving

8.2 Warranty Lifecycle
Registration → Active → Expiration/Termination → History retention

8.3 Parking Lifecycle
Assignment → Operation → Change → History storage

8.4 Fleet Lifecycle
Registration → Service linkage → Operation → Termination

## 9. Security Model
- Admin authentication system
- Hashed password storage
- Session-based authentication
